# BattleShip Project
1. There was no interaction pattern, but by looking at what they were asking for we were able to work backwards and figure that we needed a new game class and a runner file. As far as design we just tried to think about the rules of the game and make sure that we were working within those.

2. Adding more edge cases to make sure that each test was as thorough as possible and that every input was the desired input. Also we could probably refactor a little bit to get our code a bit cleaner.

3. Almost exclusively driver/navigator. At the beginning we both did independent research on how the gae would look overall so that we each brought something of value to the pairing sessions.

4. Feedback was shared directly and in the moment since we were working together pretty much the whole time.
